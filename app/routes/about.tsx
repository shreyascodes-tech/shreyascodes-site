          <p className="mt-4 text-xl max-w-[65ch] leading-8">
            I am Shreyas Mididoddi an {calculateAge()} years old software
            developer intrested in math and computer science. I am obsessed with
            technology and learning new things every day. I am involved with
            tech from my childhood. When I was approximately 12 years old I came
            across a YouTube titled something like "Make your own social network
            site from scratch" and I was soo intrested in building something
            like that so I started learning HTML4 form{" "}
            <a
              className="text-sky-700 underline underline-offset-2"
              href="http://html.net"
            >
              html.net
            </a>{" "}
            and slowly learnt HTML 5, CSS and some php online and at some point
            I was so addicted to programming that I kept learning from then on.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-xl max-w-[65ch] leading-8">
            Slowly but consistantly I was learning a lot of things, I learnt web
            dev with php. All of this on my uncle's computer which was like 12 -
            13 years old and on one fine day, I went to my uncle's home and
            turned on the PC which then let out the magic smoke and there went
            all my projects and then came my 11th grade and in India this is a
            big deal because all the maths students are expected to write JEE
            mains and Advanced examinations at the end of 12 th grade so there
            went my 2 years working like 10 hours a day at school, coaching and
            a lot of practice tests
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-xl max-w-[65ch] leading-8">
            Amidst all of this hectic schedule I still managed to practiced a
            lot of pragramming but didn't manage to build any real applications
            due to lack of time. Then I joined college and this was the time
            skipped my classes to learn new frameworks, libraries and
            programming languages and this continues till date; and that was my
            story
